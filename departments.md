# OFTC Departments #

Responsibilities for managing OFTC are delegated into loosely-defined
"departments". The following departments exist:

## Infrastructure Department ##

The Infrastructure Department is responsible for managing OFTC's servers
(dedicated and not), as well as OFTC's IRC network and any other services that
OFTC offers to members or the public at large.

Currently the Infrastructure Department is made up of:

 * Joerg Jaspert (Ganneff)
 * Martin Zobel-Helas (zobel)
 * Christoph Berg (Myon)

## Coding Department ##

The Coding Department is responsible for maintaining codebases specific to OFTC
(such as the IRC daemon and IRC services daemon), as well as fixing any bugs
that crop up in stock code.

Currently the Coding Department is made up of:

 * Luca Filipozzi (luca)

Others from staff are known to contribute from time to time as well.

OFTC [maintains repositories on github](https://github.com/oftc) where you can
file issues or merge requests. If you're interested in contributing patches to
our code bases please be sure to familiarize yourself with our
[CodingStyle](/CodingStyle) and visit [CodingProjects](/CodingProjects).
