# Network Policy

Keep in mind the following things:

 * IRC is not a right
 * IRC is not a democracy
 * OFTC is run by a set of [volunteers](/staff) who are governed by a
[guiding document](/constitution).

The network policy is purposefully vague and ambiguous as to provide us
comfortable working room:

 * Users may create and join any channel providing they fit within the rest of
this policy
 * Nickname and Channel registration is first come first serve, however there
is a [drop policy](/FAQ/Services/#i-want-to-register-a-nickname-someone-else-already-has)
 * Off topic channels should be [+s](/ChannelModes).
   - Off topic channels are those not related to the development/use of free and
open source software.
   - Off-topic channels are allowed on the basis that they do not cause
disruption to other network users and get minimal attention from OFTC staff
 * Illegal activity is strictly prohibited and offenders will be removed from
the network without warning
 * Channel disputes are the channel's problem, network staff will not get
involved.
   - However a badly behaving user may quickly escalate to a network issue if
they are subverting the ability for channel operators to maintain order.
 * Discrimination based on faith, ethnicity, sexual orientation, sex or gender 
expression, disability, or age is not permitted.
