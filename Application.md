Section 1: Important Information
--------------------------------

Please be aware that all applications will be reviewed by the Network
Operations Committee and are subject to the NOC's approval or rejection. In
addition, all OFTC staff may be consulted on your application. OFTC reserves
the right to request further information from applicants before considering the
application. OFTC also reserves the right to confirm the veracity of any
information received. Your application will also be kept as part of the network records.

If any member of the Network Operations Committee approves the application,
that member will present the application at the next meeting where the
application will be discussed. It will either be voted upon or deferred until a
later date.

In order to avoid favouritism and a bloated staff, only as many positions will
be filled as are required. As such, you may qualify for and deserve a position,
but may not be granted it. You will be notified if that is the case, and
remembered when any position opens.

If the application is accepted by a simple majority vote of the Network
Operations Committee, the applicant will be contacted by the Network Operations
Committee Chair at the earliest opportunity and will be provided with the
appropriate position guidelines.

Positions are not permanent and may be acquired or lost during the annual 
elections, or for various reasons between elections. All staff may vote in 
those elections and all staff are automatically entered to run for all roles, 
as explained in section 3 of OFTC's constitution, found at:

https://www.oftc.net/constitution/

Please note that all staff members except for server sponsors are expected to 
attend monthly staff meetings, regardless of their roles. Attendance is taken
and staff members, or sponsors whose servers are not on line, for two meetings
in a row without notification may be asked to leave staff.

Rejected applications may not be responded to.
