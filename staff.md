# Who to turn to for assistance #

The Network Staff are responsible for the maintenance and well-being of the
Network and its users. Many staff members have multiple roles, and not all roles
are listed here. These are the people you should seek for assistance.

Staff are assigned to their roles during annual staff-wide elections from the
8th to the 11th of every October. Between elections, staff may be promoted,
demoted, added, or removed by the Network Operations Committee,
as outlined in the Network's
[Constitution](/constitution), which also outlines the rules for the elections.
OFTC's constitution is enforced by resolution
[2002-07-02.iwj.5](http://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/resolutions/2002/2002-07-02.iwj.5/)
of [Software in the Public Interest's](http://www.spi-inc.org/) Board of
Directors.

When connected to our IRC network, staff are identifiable by their hostmasks:
`<staffmember>.<role>.oftc.net`. Users may also request a cloaked hostmask,for
information see [UserCloaks](/UserCloaks).

If you would like to join our staff or sponsor a server, please refer to our
[Application](/Application) and send it via mail.
