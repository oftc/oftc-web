 * OFTC wants to upgrade the services in use to the Atheme variant. One user
   visible change will be the uniqueness of SSL cert fingerprints for accounts.
   If you are using SSL CertFP to identify to your accounts, please review the
   fingerprints associated with your account(s) and ensure that they are not
   duplicated between your accounts. This only applies if you have multiple
   separate accounts using the same fingerprint. Linked/grouped nicks are only a
   single account.

   We intend to remove any remaining duplicate fingerprint entries on
   2022-11-22. The removal algorithm will delete duplicates from all but the
   most recently used account.
