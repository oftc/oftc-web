  * Late yesterday evening (Thursday 28 June 2018) OFTC staff became aware of successful unauthorized access to a number
    of OFTC user accounts. All evidence points to the unauthorized access being the result of a combination of weak
    account passwords and an attacker potentially using credential dumps from other online services.

    The impact appears to have been limited to channels under the control of the compromised user accounts. OFTC and its
    services have not been compromised.

    Known affected users have had their passwords reset and we will be working with those users to help them regain
    access. If your account was not impacted, please ensure that you are using a
    [strong, unique password](https://xkcd.com/792/) for your OFTC account.
