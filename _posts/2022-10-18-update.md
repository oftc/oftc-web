 * OFTC wants to upgrade the services in use to the Atheme variant.
   One user visible change will be the uniqueness of SSL cert fingerprints for
   accounts. If you are using SSL CertFP to identify to your accounts, please
   review the fingerprints associated with your account(s) and ensure that they
   are not duplicated between your accounts.

   We intend to remove any remaining duplicate fingerprint entries at 2022-11-18.
   The removal algorithm will delete duplicates from all but the most recently used account.
